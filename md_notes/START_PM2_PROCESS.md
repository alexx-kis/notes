# How to start an app with PM2 (step-by-step)

## 0. Prerequisites (don’t skip, this is where most pain is born)

- Node.js installed

- Your project already builds and runs locally

- You are in the project root

- PM2 installed globally

- If PM2 is not installed yet:

`npm install -g pm2`

Check:

`pm2 -v`


- If this fails — stop. Fix Node/npm first.

## 1. Decide what exactly PM2 should run

- PM2 does not magically understand frameworks.
- It runs commands or JS files.

### Common cases:
✅ Next.js (production)
You must build first, then run next start.

✅ Vite
You usually run a preview server or a custom Node server.

## 2. Build the project (mandatory for prod)

**Next.js**: `npm run build`
- This creates .next/.

**Vite** `npm run build`
- This creates dist/.

If build fails → PM2 will not save you. Fix build first.

## 3. Start PM2 process

🔹 Next.js (recommended way)

`pm2 start npm --name "next-app" -- start`


- Explanation (important):

`npm` — PM2 runs npm itself

`-- start` — maps to npm run start

`"next-app"` — your process name (pick something sane)

- Your package.json must have:

```
"scripts": {
  "start": "next start"
}
```

🔹 Vite (preview mode)

`pm2 start npm --name "vite-app" -- run preview`


- Your package.json must include:

```
"scripts": {
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```

⚠️ Reminder: vite preview is not a real production server.
Fine for internal tools, not fine for high-traffic public apps.

## 4. Check that it’s actually running

`pm2 status`


- You should see:

```
status: online

restarts: 0 (or low)

correct name

Logs (always check logs):

pm2 logs next-app
```

or

`pm2 logs vite-app`


- If it crashes — logs will tell you why.

## 5. Make PM2 survive server reboot (CRITICAL)

- If you skip this, PM2 dies on reboot and you’ll pretend it’s “random”.

`pm2 startup`


- PM2 will print a command like:

`sudo env PATH=...`


👉 Copy it and run it exactly.

- Then save current processes:

`pm2 save`

## 6. Useful everyday commands (memorize these)

Restart app: `pm2 restart next-app`

Stop app: `pm2 stop next-app`


Delete app: `pm2 delete next-app`


Watch logs: `pm2 logs`


Live CPU / memory: `pm2 monit`


Common mistakes (aka “why prod is down”)

❌ Running pm2 start npm -- run dev
→ Dev mode is not production. Ever.

❌ Forgetting pm2 save
→ Reboot = app gone.

❌ App works locally but not in PM2
→ Environment variables missing (.env, ports, NODE_ENV).

❌ Port already in use
→ Check with:

`pm2 logs`

Minimal TL;DR

npm install -g pm2

npm run build

pm2 start npm --name "app-name" -- start

pm2 startup

pm2 save
