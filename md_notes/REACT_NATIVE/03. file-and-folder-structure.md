# File and folder structure of the application

- create a new folder inside `app`-folder, which will be within parentheses (it is considered a route group like in next.js)
```
(auth)
```

- in this (auth)-folder we will create a new `_layout.tsx` file

- we need to create a separate layout for auth, because this screen doesn't have a bottom navigation bar

- create new files `sign-in.tsx` and `sign-up.tsx`

- create a new route group also with parentheses `(tabs)`
- within tabs we're going to create a new custom layout `TabsLayout`
- here we will create a tab bar that is in the bottom of the screen that allows to navigate between app's screens

- create `bookmark`, `create`, `home` and `profile` screens in the `(tabs)` folder

- also we will create a `search` folder
- here we will use a concept coming directly from next.js - dynamic route
- in `search` folder create `[query].tsx` file
- this will allow us to rename the page or get the query information for the specific search our user is trying to do

- we have no way to navigate between these routes
- in `(tabs)/_layout.tsx` we will create the bottom tabs bar that will allow to navigate between the pages of the app
